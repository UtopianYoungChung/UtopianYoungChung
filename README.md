## About Me

I am an incoming PhD student at the Faculty of Information, University of Toronto, starting in May ‚òÄÔ∏è, under the guidance of Professor Eric Yu. My academic journey bridges data, technology, and human-centered design, driven by a commitment to ethical AI frameworks that promote sustainable business innovation. I hold a Master of Digital Experience Innovation from the University of Waterloo and a Bachelor of Information Science from the University of Toronto. My background includes over a decade of experience in safety-critical environments, specializing in data analysis and agile project management. These experiences have shaped my approach to developing equitable, human-centered AI systems that address systemic challenges in real-world contexts.

My academic development includes studies in Statistics at York University, which honed my analytical skills, and a Bachelor of Information at U of T, which expanded my understanding of technology's social and organizational impact. Courses in human-technology interactions and the societal impact of technology were particularly influential.

## My Research

My PhD research will focus on socio-technical models that aim to reduce systemic biases in AI systems, promote equitable integration through participatory frameworks, and establish governance strategies for transparency and accountability. This involves bridging ethical principles with practical applications to support fair and transparent decision-making in AI, especially in areas like healthcare where biases can harm vulnerable groups.

I am particularly interested in developing actionable, domain-specific solutions by drawing from established methodologies. My experiences in projects like the Statistical Society of Canada competition and HealthNet Ontario emphasized data-driven decision-making and public trust, reinforcing my dedication to AI research that aligns with transparency and adaptability.

Ultimately, my research aims to drive ethical AI integration in digital transformation, prioritizing sustainability and societal impact. This could involve optimizing public transportation for reduced emissions and enhanced accessibility or introducing AI frameworks to corporations to address issues like resource equity and job displacement.

## Connection with Professor Eric Yu's Research

I am excited to be working with Professor Eric Yu, whose foundational work in the i* framework and agent-oriented modeling provides a strong basis for my research into socio-technical systems and ethical AI. Professor Yu's research emphasizes the importance of modeling and analyzing the relationships among stakeholders in complex systems, which is crucial for understanding and mitigating biases in AI and ensuring equitable integration. His work on using the i* framework to understand strategic actor relationships and the impact of technology on social contexts directly aligns with my goal of developing transparent and accountable AI frameworks.

Professor Yu's concept of agent-oriented modeling for the age of AI, shifting the focus from specifying target technology to exploring how stakeholders might augment their "selves", provides a valuable perspective for my research on human-centered AI and participatory frameworks. His emphasis on incorporating social context into systems analysis further strengthens the connection to my research on socio-technical systems. While Professor Yu is now Professor Emeritus, I am grateful for his continued mentorship and support.
